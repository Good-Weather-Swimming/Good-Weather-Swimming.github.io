## Features

- **Multi-location Support**: Easily manage multiple swimming locations
- **Dynamic Pages**: Each location gets its own dedicated page at:
  - `/cyprus-peyia-coral-bay-beach/`
  - `/cyprus-peyia-laourou-beach/`
- **Home Page**: Centralized entry point with all locations listed
- **Responsive Design**: Beautiful UI with Tailwind CSS
- **Weather Integration**: Embedded calendar with real-time weather forecasts
- **Location Navigation**: Quick switcher between locations in navbar
- **GitHub Pages**: Automated deployment on push to `main` branch

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Local Development

```bash
# Start development server with live reload
npm run serve
```

Or separately:
```bash
# Watch for changes
npm run watch

# Build the site
npm run build
```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

## Editing Content

### Adding a New Location

1. **Update `src/_data/locations.js`** with new location data:

```javascript
{
  id: "your-beach-id",
  name: "Your Beach Name",
  urlPath: "/cyprus-peyia-your-beach/",
  region: "Peyia, Paphos",
  coordinates: {
    lat: 34.xxx,
    lng: 32.xxx,
    zoom: 15
  },
  googleMapsEmbed: "https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=...",
  description: "Beach description",
  whatsappGroup: "https://chat.whatsapp.com/...",
  meetingNotes: "How to find the group",
  weatherDataUrl: "https://rezerv.it/weather/v1/forecast?latitude=34.xxx&longitude=32.xxx&preset=openwater_swimming"
}
```

2. **Create a new page** at `src/your-beach.html`:

```yaml
---
layout: location.html
permalink: /cyprus-peyia-your-beach/
location: "{{ locations.locations[X] }}"
---
```

Replace `X` with the array index of your new location.

### Customizing Location Info

Edit the meeting notes, WhatsApp group links, and other location-specific details in `src/_data/locations.js`.

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages Workflow

The site automatically deploys to GitHub Pages when you push to the `main` branch. The workflow:

1. Installs Node.js dependencies
2. Builds the site with Eleventy
3. Deploys to GitHub Pages

View the workflow status in `.github/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml`

### Manual Deployment

```bash
npm run build
# Output is in _site/ directory
```

## Technologies
